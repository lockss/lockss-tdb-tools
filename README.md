# LOCKSS TDB Tools

This project is a collection of projects used to process LOCKSS TDB files. TDB files contain a textual representation of publishers, titles and archival units, that can be converted into data consumed by the LOCKSS software to know what content is available to be preserved.

It consists of several sub-projects:

*   [**`lockss-tdb-processor`**](lockss-tdb-tools): suite of Java tools to process TDB files
*   [**`lockss-tdbxml-maven-plugin`**](lockss-tdb-tools): Maven plugin to invoke the `tdbxml` tool from `lockss-tdb-tools`

Other TDB-related tools will join this project in the future.
